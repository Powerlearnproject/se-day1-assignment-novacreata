# SE_Day1


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is maintenance of high quality software systems by applying engineering principles
importance ; allows creation of  software systems for use in different fields, allows update of  software 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
developmentof programming languages , occurred in the 1950's to 50s with languages such as fotran and c
software engineering as a discipline,in the 60s
structured programming, started in 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirement,identifying user neds and systems requirements 
design , building  system framework 
implementation,writing code and building systems according to design specification  
testing , running the design  to determine its workability
deployment ,rolling out software to the market 
maintenance , updating software 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall uses a sequential approach and has distinct phases hence predictable  while agile uses iterative and incremental approach making it less predictable 
waterfall would be suitable for constant data eg reading applications while agile would be appropriate for currency exchange web calculator

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer ,write code and implement software solution
quality assurance engineer ,design and execute  test plan for quality software
project manager, oversees  planning ,execution and delivery of software

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

provide code quality through debugging tools,
enhanced collaboration by enhanced teamwork 
enhanced productivity through comprehensive tools 
what are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements , can be overcome by keeping up with the latest news
tght deadlines, one should reassess goals and time lines regularly 
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit ,tests individual component 
integration , testing interaction between different component and subsystems 
system , testing entire software 
acceptance , testing against user requirements 
testing helps  notice and fix early problems 

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is creating the appropriate  question or instruction to get the desired outcomes 
it allows ai to give exactly what one needs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, speicific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
what is coding
explain the definition of coding to a student  with no prior knowledge and give an example 
the improved prompt is more specific
